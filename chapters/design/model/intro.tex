In order for tenant applications to request \gls{inp} resources, there must be one or multiple models capable of describing them.
This chapter will first discuss the integration of \gls{inp} resources in currently used models described in \autoref{models_analysis} and will then introduce a proposed model which must be capable of describing existing \gls{inp} solutions and possibly even future ones.
