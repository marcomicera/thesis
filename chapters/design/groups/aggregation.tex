Examples:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Daiet \cite{daiet}
    \item SHArP \cite{sharp}
\end{itemize}
Network devices must:
\begin{itemize}
    \item form a tree whose root is connected to data consumers and whose leaves are connected to data producers
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Daiet \cite{daiet}: just one data consumer
        \item SHArP \cite{sharp}: one or more data consumers
    \end{itemize}
    \item dedicate part of their local memory to store a key-value map
    \item be able to perform basic operations on data, such as writing and hashing
    \item wait for all its children to send aggregated data
\end{itemize}
Data producers must:
\begin{itemize}
    \item be connected to exactly one tree leaf
\end{itemize}
Data consumer(s) must:
\begin{itemize}
    \item be connected to the tree root
\end{itemize}
A special unit:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Daiet \cite{daiet}: must push flow rules to all switches belonging to at least one tree. It is the \gls{sdn} controller.
    \item SHArP \cite{sharp}: must act as a \gls{rm}, dedicating SHArP \cite{sharp} resources to those entities who request for them. It must not necessarily be the \gls{sdn} controller.
\end{itemize}
