\Glspl{resource:composite} can have multiple properties specifying some application requirements or constraints.

A first approach called \textit{passive mapping} would require tenant applications to explicitly express internal \glspl{resource:composite}' properties that \textbf{directly} affect their equivalent expressed in terms of just \glspl{resource:logical}.
\ifdefined\THESISSUMMARY \else
\autoref{passivemapping} shows an example of a tenant application explicitly specifying the chain length of its IncBricks \cite{incbricks} \gls{resource:composite} and the bandwidth demands $B_1$ and $B_2$ towards and outwards it, respectively.
\fi
This, of course, increases the expressiveness of the tenant application with the cost of making the interface more complex to
\ifdefined\THESISSUMMARY
use.

\fi
With the opposite approach (\textit{active mapping}), tenant applications do not have to specify internal \glspl{resource:composite}' properties, but instead more abstract performance goals.
These high-level \glspl{resource:composite}' goals will be then translated by the \gls{rm}.
\ifdefined\THESISSUMMARY \else
An example of this translation is showed in \autoref{passivemapping}, where the requested tuple rate is transformed accordingly into topology and bandwidth constraints.
\fi
This approach simplifies the interface exposed to tenant applications by not letting them taking care of internal \glspl{resource:composite}' properties that might be unknown to
\ifdefined\THESISSUMMARY
developers.
