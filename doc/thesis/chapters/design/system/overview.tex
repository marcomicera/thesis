As required by \ref{requirements:model:tenant:composites} and \ref{requirements:model:tenant:logical}, tenant applications must be able to express their requests in terms of \glspl{resource:logical} and \glspl{resource:composite}.
The latter are just a simplification for tenant applications, and they need to be translated into a set of \glspl{resource:logical} for the placement algorithm to allocate those.
This translation can be done by the \gls{rm} by means of a \textit{template database}, that maps pre-determined \glspl{resource:composite} into their equivalent made out of just \glspl{resource:logical}, as shown in \autoref{compositestological}.

\Glspl{resource:logical} represent the input of the placement algorithm. Those will be assigned to \glspl{resource:physical}, as shown in \autoref{logicaltophysical}.
