Tenant applications need a \gls{model:tenant} to be able to include \gls{inp} resources in their requests.
This chapter will first discuss the integration of \gls{inp} resources in a \gls{rm} using currently-existing models described in \autoref{models_analysis} and will then introduce a model proposal which must be capable of describing existing \gls{inp} solutions and possibly even future ones.
