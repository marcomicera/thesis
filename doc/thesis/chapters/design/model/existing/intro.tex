Different resource models (\autoref{models_analysis}) are currently used by \glspl{rm} to offer and manage data center resources.
Most of the times they are just server resources, but some \glspl{rmf} like \cite{kraken, cloudmirror, oktopus} also provide bandwidth provisioning.
A lot of them are network-aware in the sense that they are aware of failuer domains.
Still, no model consider pure \gls{inp} resources.

For each resource model previously described in \autoref{models_analysis}, this section will discuss
\begin{mylist}
    \item whether it is possible to describe \gls{inp} resources without changing the model and
    \item some possible modifications that could achieve that
\end{mylist}.
