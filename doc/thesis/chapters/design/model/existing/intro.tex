Different \glspl{model} (\autoref{models_analysis}) are currently used by \glspl{rm} to offer and manage data center resources.
Most of the times they allow the description of \glspl{resource:logical:server} only, but some \glspl{rmf} like \cite{kraken, cloudmirror, oktopus} also provide bandwidth provisioning by allowing tenants to request for \glspl{resource:logical:edge}.
A lot of them are network-aware in the sense being aware of failure domains.
\cite{ontackling} allows tenants to request \glspl{resource:logical:switch} but it does not allow them to request \glspl{resource:logical:edge} and \glspl{resource:composite}.

This section will discuss whether each \gls{model} previously described in \autoref{models_analysis} can be used for this system or not, confronting them with the requirement list reported in \autoref{requirements:model}.
