\paragraph{Quick recap}
\glsreset{vc}
The \gls{vc} model consists in $N$ \glspl{vm} connected to a single \textit{virtual switch} by a link of bandwidth $B$.
\autoref{vcfigurerecap} shows an example.

\paragraph{Requirements check}
Expressing just one value of bandwidth $B$ for all connections is indeed a big limitation.
One could assign to $B$ the highest bandwidth demand in case different nodes require different amounts of bandwidth, but this is obviously a waste of resources.
This does not completely satisfy \xmark \ref{requirements:model:bandwidth}.
The \gls{tivc} model introduced in Proteus \cite{proteus} overcomes this limitation since bandwidth constraints are expressed by time-varying functions instead of a constant fixed value.
Both models though 
\begin{mylist}
    \item rely on a single virtual switch that is not suitable for tenant applications which require a more complex logical switch topology such as a chain or a tree (\xmark \ref{requirements:model:topology}) and
    \item do not support \gls{resource:logical:switch} requests (\xmark \ref{requirements:model:tenant:logical})
\end{mylist}.

    \paragraph{A possible modification}
    Since specifying the same bandwidth demand $B$ for all \glspl{vm} is restrictive, one trivial solution could consist in allowing the model to specify different values of $B$, like depicted in \autoref{fig:vcmod}.
    
    \begin{figure}[!htb]
        \centering
        \usebox{\vcmodfigure}
        \caption{A possible \gls{vc} variant}
        \label{fig:vcmod}
    \end{figure}
    
    Still, the one-level tree topology remains a problem for those applications which require a more complex logical switch topology: regarding this, a natural \gls{vc} extension is the \gls{voc} model, hence leaving aside the former model in favor of the latter one.
