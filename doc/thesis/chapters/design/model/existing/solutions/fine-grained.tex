%\paragraph{Quick recap}

\paragraph{Its role in \texorpdfstring{\gls{inp}}{INP}}
This model has always been used to describe server resources only.
Unless the request contains additional data like high-level goals (\autoref{hlg_analysis}), \glspl{rm} using this model will not handle network resources.
For instance, even though Oktopus \cite{oktopus} supports bandwidth reservation when the request is expressed by means of the \gls{vc} or \gls{voc} model, it will not provide any bandwidth guarantees to those tenants who do not use a virtual network model.

\paragraph{A possible modification}
% Even though a list of resource demands is the most descriptive options amongst them all, the \gls{inp} resource description is still an open problem.
% Network devices requirements could be also expressed by means of a similar list, as well as bandwidth guarantees between two nodes.
% However, enforcing a logical topology amongst network devices becomes less intuitive
