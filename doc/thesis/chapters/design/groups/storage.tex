Example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item IncBricks \cite{incbricks}
\end{itemize}
Network devices must:
\begin{itemize}
    \item form a chain that connects the two communicating nodes
    \item dedicate part of their local memory to store a key-value cache
\end{itemize}
The query issuer:
\begin{itemize}
    \item executes queries
    \item is a logical server resource
    \item must be connected to the head switch
\end{itemize}
The data owner:
\begin{itemize}
    \item owns data
    \item is a server logical resource
    \item must be connected to the tail switch
    \item is not the query issuer
    \item can reply to queries in case no switch has cached the data
\end{itemize}
The \gls{sdn} controller must:
\begin{itemize}
    \item be connected to all the network devices
    \item configure network devices in order for them to forward IncBricks \cite{incbricks} packets along the switch chain
\end{itemize}
