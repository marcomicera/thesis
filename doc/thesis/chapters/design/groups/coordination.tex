Example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item NetChain \cite{netchain}
\end{itemize}
Network devices must:
\begin{itemize}
    \item form a chain
    \item dedicate part of their local memory to store a distributed map
    \item execute coordination primitives
\end{itemize}
Query issuers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item execute queries
    \item are logical server resources
    \item must directly contact either the head switch or the tail one
    \item must include the list of IP addresses of all switches belonging to the chain in the packet
\end{itemize}
The \gls{sdn} controller:
\begin{itemize}
    \item must be connected to all the network devices
    \item must form the chain and handle switches reconfigurations
\end{itemize}
