The scheduler used for this evaluation uses a simple greedy placement algorithm that cycles through all \glspl{resource:physical} every time a job needs to be scheduled.
It tries to allocate as many tasks as possible on the same \glslink{resource:physical}{physical machine} simply by
\begin{mylist}
    \item checking the amount of available numerical resources and
    \item performing the \textit{properties} check for switch tasks
    \ifdefined\THESISSUMMARY
    (i.e., whether a \gls{resource:physical:switch} supports a specific \gls{resource:composite:inp})
    \else
    as described in \autoref{simulator_switch_resources}
    \fi
\end{mylist}.
