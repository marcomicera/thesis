Experiments ran on Dell C6420 servers on CloudLab \cite{cloudlab}, simulating a 1 day long workload. % FIXME sim time

\subsection{Metrics}
These simulations focus on the average \glslink{resource:physical}{resource} utilization in the data center for all dimensions.
Different simulations vary in the ratio between tenant requests including \gls{inp} composites over those requests including \glspl{resource:logical:server} only.
