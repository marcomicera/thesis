This chapter aims to evaluate the system designed in \autoref{design}.
More specifically, the ultimate goal is to show new challenges and problems brought by the introduction of \gls{inp} resources and \glspl{resource:composite} into the resource management layer.

Ultimately, it is expected that these two kinds of \glspl{resource:physical} (\glslink{resource:physical:server}{server} and \glslink{resource:physical:switch}{switch physical resources}) can act as a bottleneck for each other, as \glspl{resource:physical:switch} are very limited compared to \glslink{resource:physical:server}{server} ones (\autoref{simulator_cell}).
