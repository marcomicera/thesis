\section{In-network data aggregation}
Examples:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Daiet \cite{daiet}
    \item SHArP \cite{sharp}
\end{itemize}
Network devices must:
\begin{itemize}
    \item form a tree whose root is connected to the sink VM and whose leaves are connected to data producers
    \item dedicate part of their local memory to store a key-value map
    \item be able to perform basic operations on data, such as writing and hashing
\end{itemize}
The sink must:
\begin{itemize}
    \item be connected to the tree root
\end{itemize}
Data producers must:
\begin{itemize}
    \item be connected to exactly one tree leaf
\end{itemize}

\section{In-network data storage}
Examples:
\begin{itemize}
    \item NetChain \cite{netchain}
    \item IncBricks \cite{incbricks}
\end{itemize}
Network devices must:
\begin{itemize}
    \item form a chain connecting the two communicating nodes
    \item store data along the path
\end{itemize}
