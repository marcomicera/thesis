Perhaps the most fundamental technology without which \gls{inp} would not even be possible.

\gls{sdn} is a networking paradigm whose main pillar is the separation of the control and data plane.
Network switches become simple forwarding devices (e.g., OpenFlow \cite{openflow} switches), while the brain of a Software-Defined Network resides in its logically centralized \gls{sdn} controller, which exercises direct control over the state in the data plane elements via an \gls{sbi}.
Lots of surveys (e.g., \cite{kreutz2014software} and \cite{kim2013improving}) often associate \gls{sdn} with OpenFlow \cite{openflow}, as it is by far the most common \gls{sbi}.
