Within this project, data center \gls{inp} refers to the technique of delegating some parts of computation to programmable switches, hence reducing servers' workload.

Common operations performed by these devices are data aggregation and key-value storage management.

% TODO INP definition

% Approaches that make use of middle-boxes do not fall within this definition of \gls{inp}.
% This is why \gls{inp} is different from \textit{active networking} and \gls{nfv}.
