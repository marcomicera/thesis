The elementary computational unit in a data center is called \textit{node}.
As mentioned in \autoref{rm_background}, nodes are being virtualized by means of \glspl{vm} and containers.
Nodes are run on \textit{servers}, which are grouped in \textit{racks}.
Server racks are usually connected through a so-called \gls{tor} switch.
Racks of servers are then grouped into \textit{cells}, that some times may be special-purpose.
Usually a cell is grouped with a few small test ones to form up a \textit{cluster}.
Most of the \glspl{rm} manage resources in one cluster.
One or more clusters form a \textit{data center}, which together form a \textit{site}.
