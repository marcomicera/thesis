Within this project, \gls{inp} refers to the technique that exploits network switches to modify and/or store data packets, without involving any kind of higher-layer devices.
Therefore, approaches that make use of middle-boxes do not fall within our definition of INP.
This is why \gls{inp} is different from \textit{active networking} and \gls{nfv}.
