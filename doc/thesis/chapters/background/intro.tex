\glsreset{inp}
\glsreset{rm}
This chapter aims to introduce the fundamental technologies used in data centers, without which \gls{inp} would not even be possible.
This chapter starts with a general description of how resources are managed in a data center \autoref{rm_background} (e.g., \glsentrylongpl{vm}) and ends with a brief introduction of network techniques and concepts which are strictly related to \glsentrylongpl{rm}.
