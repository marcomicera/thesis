\glsreset{nfv}
An \gls{sdn}-related (but not dependent) concept is \gls{nfv}. 

The virtualization techniques previously mentioned in \autoref{rm_background} (e.g., \glspl{vm} and containers) can also be used to virtualize network functions (e.g., firewalls, network monitors, etc.) to obtain all the advantages that come along with virtualization in general, such as better resources utilization, fault-tolerance, higher flexibility, and so on.

This decouples network services software from any kind of dedicated hardware.
\Glspl{vnf} can be run in fact on standard commodity servers, allowing a more flexible network deployment.

\gls{sdn} and \gls{nfv} are complementary, but one does not depend upon the other.
