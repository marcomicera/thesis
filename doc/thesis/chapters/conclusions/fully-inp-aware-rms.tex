\cite{ontackling} considers both \glslink{resource:logical:switch}{server} and \glspl{resource:logical:switch} during allocation, but it does not place them during the same scheduling round.
The drawback of not scheduling these two kinds of \glslink{resource:logical}{resources} conjunctly causes the placement algorithm to derive a sub-optimal

placement, as explained in \autoref{network_resources-aware_rms}.

\fi
Ideally, an \gls{rm} should allocate a job considering its \glslink{resource:logical:switch}{server} and \glspl{resource:logical:switch} at the same time, i.e., during the same placement round.

\fi
To maximize the (relative) minimum \gls{resource:physical} utilization, the \gls{rm} would need to adjust the ratio of \gls{inp} requests over \glslink{resource:logical:server}{servers}-only ones.
With the assumption that \glspl{resource:physical:switch} can become the bottleneck of whole the system more rapidly (e.g., less \glslink{resource:physical:switch}{switches} than \glslink{resource:physical:server}{servers} in a fat-tree with $k>5$ or for the scarceness of

in general),
\glspl{rm} should be able to propose alternatives to \glspl{resource:composite:inp} made out of \glspl{resource:logical:server} or \glspl{resource:composite:server} only, as soon as \glspl{resource:physical:switch} become heavily utilized.
Those alternatives could be stored, for instance, in the same \textit{template database}
