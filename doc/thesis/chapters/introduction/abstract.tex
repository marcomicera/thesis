Nowadays there exist several \gls{inp} solutions that allow tenants to improve their application performance in terms of different metrics: \textsc{Daiet} \cite{daiet} inventors claim to achieve a 86.9\%-89.3\% traffic reduction by performing data aggregation entirely in the network data plane.
Other solutions like \textsc{NetChain} \cite{netchain} and \textsc{IncBricks} \cite{incbricks} let programmable switches store data and process queries in order to cut end-to-end latency.
It is now even possible to provide guarantees to applications with specific requirements: for instance, \textsc{CloudMirror} \cite{cloudmirror} enables applications to reserve a minimum bandwidth.\par
For the time being, it seems that there is still no valid resource allocation algorithm that takes into account the presence of a network having a data plane that supports (partially or completely) \gls{inp}.
The objective of this thesis is to model and evaluate an \gls{api} through which applications can ask for resources in a data center exploiting \gls{inp} capabilities. % while providing guarantees (e.g., bandwidth).
