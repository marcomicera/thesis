Using \gls{inp} to scale up data centers and improve their overall performance seems a promising idea: Daiet \cite{daiet} inventors claim to achieve an 86.9\%-89.3\% traffic reduction, hence reducing workload at the servers;
NetChain \cite{netchain} can process queries entirely in the network data plane, thus eliminating the query processing at servers and cutting the end-to-end latency to as little as half of an \glsentryshort{rtt}.\\
Current data center \glspl{rm} (such as Apache YARN \cite{yarn}, Google Omega \cite{omega}) are not completely network-unaware: for instance, some of them are capable of satisfying affinity rules.
CloudMirror \cite{cloudmirror} even provides bandwidth guarantees to tenant applications.
Still, current \glspl{rm} do not consider \gls{inp} resources.
As a consequence, tenant applications cannot request these kinds of services while asking for server resources.
