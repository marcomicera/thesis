\Cref{background} introduced how resources can be managed in a data center and different network techniques such as \gls{inp} and \gls{nfv}.
This chapter's aim is to dig into the details of these systems and to extract common patterns between similar \gls{inp} solutions in order to be able to derive a model capable of fully describing \gls{inp} resources.
