\glsreset{inp}
\glsreset{nfv}
\Cref{background} introduced how resources can be managed in a data center (\autoref{rm_background}) and different network techniques such as \gls{inp} (\autoref{inp_background}) and \gls{nfv} (\autoref{nfv_background}).
This chapter's aim is to dig into the details of these systems and to extract common patterns between similar \gls{inp} solutions in order to be able to derive a model capable of fully describing \gls{inp} resources.
