\glsreset{sdn}

\Cref{background} introduced how resources can be managed in a data center (\autoref{rm_background}) and different network techniques such as \gls{sdn} (\autoref{sdn_background}), \gls{nfv} (\autoref{nfv_background}), and \gls{inp} (\autoref{inp_background}).
This chapter aims to dig into the details of these systems and to extract common patterns between similar \gls{inp} solutions to then derive a model (\autoref{model_proposal}) capable of fully describing \gls{inp} resources.
