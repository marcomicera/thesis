IncBricks \cite{incbricks} is a solution for in-network caching: it makes use of network accelerators attached to programmable switches whenever complicated operations should be performed on payloads.
Supporting multiple gigabytes of memory, network accelerators overcome the limited storage problem typical of programmable switches, which usually have a memory of tens of megabytes.

\subsection{Details}
IncBricks \cite{incbricks} is composed by two components:
\begin{mylist}
    \item IncBox, an hardware unit consisting of a network accelerator and a programmable switch, and
    \item IncCache, a software system for coherent key-value storage
\end{mylist}.
Packets arriving to an IncBox device are first managed by the switch, which forwards the packet to the network accelerator only if it is labeled as an in-network cache one.
The storage has been implemented using a bucket spilling hash table plus a hash index table
