Rather than a fully descriptive resource model, high-level goals specification can be seen as an add-on to the other previously-mentioned models that is worth mentioning for the purpose of this thesis.
Taking Bazaar \cite{bazaar} as an example, one possible high-level goal is the job completion time.
Goals like these eventually need to be translated into classic resource requirements to be correctly interpreted by a \gls{rm}.
