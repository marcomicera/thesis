There are currently no \glspl{rm} nowadays that
\begin{mylist}
    \item handle \glslink{resource:logical:server}{logical server}, \glslink{resource:logical:switch}{switch} and \glslink{resource:logical:edge}{edge resources},
    \item support high-level requests (e.g., with the use of \glspl{resource:composite}) and
    \item are capable of considering multiple resource dimensions
\end{mylist}.
However, there are different schedulers that fulfill, even partially, a subset of those requirements.
This paragraph tries to cover all the aspects of \gls{inp}-integration from a theoretical point of view.
