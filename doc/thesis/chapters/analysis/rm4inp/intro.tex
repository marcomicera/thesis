There is currently no \gls{rm} nowadays that
\begin{mylist}
    \item handles all logical server, switch and edge resources,
    \item supports high-level requests (e.g., with the use of composites) and
    \item is capable of considering multiple resource dimensions
\end{mylist}.
However, there are different schedulers that fulfill, even partially, a subset of those requirements.
This paragraph tries to cover all the aspects of \gls{inp}-integration from a theoretical point of view.
