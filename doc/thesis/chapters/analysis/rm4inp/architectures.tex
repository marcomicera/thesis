Different \gls{rm} scheduling architectures were introduced in \autoref{rm_architectures}.
This section tries to analyze how can different scheduling architectures manage \gls{inp} resources and what are the drawbacks brought by each one of them.\par
This brief analysis does not make any assumption regarding the \gls{inp} resource model since its format is out of the scope of this specific section.

\paragraph{Monolithic}
In this architecture, resource requests cannot be concurrent by definition since there is just one logically centralized scheduler.
However, this architecture does not scale due to its intrinsic nature.
Such a scheduling architecture could be used later on to build up a simple dummy \gls{inp}-aware scheduler that might act as the standard baseline used to compare the actual scheduler developed in \autoref{design}.

\paragraph{Two-level}
In the two-level architecture a centralized node master (or \textit{allocator}) proposes resources to the schedulers.
Let us suppose that the allocator not only proposes server resources, but also \gls{inp} ones: during the period of time which lasts from the instant in which resources are offered until the scheduler accepts or denies the offer, all resources must be locked.
Locking \gls{inp} resources though means locking either network devices' resources (to perform computation) or links' bandwidth (for guarantees), which can heavily affect the performance of all nodes using these shared network resources.\par
One could think of not locking \gls{inp} resources during the delay introduced by the scheduler when accepting or denying the request, but the allocator would need to repeat the whole resource offering process if a scheduler accepts some \gls{inp} resources that have been acquired by some other scheduler during this period of time.

\paragraph{Shared-state}
A shared-state scheduler could include the \gls{inp} resources state in the \textit{cell state} data structure.
Supposing that tenant applications can request for both server and \gls{inp} resources, schedulers will try to acquire those by modifying the cell state through an atomic commit.
Schedulers that will have to satisfy requests containing supposedly-longer resource request lists are more likely to cause an higher amount of conflicts when attempting to write the share cell state data structure.
This could heavily affect the whole \gls{rm} performance.
