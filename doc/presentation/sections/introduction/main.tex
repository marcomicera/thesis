    % HPC, thousands of requests
    \begin{aquote}{NetChain \cite{netchain} authors}
        \textbf{Modern Internet services}, such as search, social networking and e-commerce, \textbf{critically depend on high-performance key-value stores}. Rendering even a single web page often requires hundreds or even thousands of storage accesses.

    % Need to scale up
    \begin{aquote}{SHArP \cite{sharp} authors}
        As the number of compute elements grows, and the need to expose and utilize higher levels of parallelism grows, \textbf{it is essential to [...] focus on developing architectures that lend themselves better to providing extreme-scale simulation capabilities}.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\gls{inp}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item INP refers to the technique of \textbf{offloading some parts of the computation to network devices} (e.g., programmable switches, network accelerators, middleboxes, etc.), hence reducing the load on servers
        \item Advantages:
        \begin{enumerate} % From IncBricks
            \item Serve network requests on the fly with low latency
            \item Reduce data center traffic and mitigate network congestion
            \item Save energy by running servers in a low-power mode
        \end{enumerate}
        % \item (Daiet introduction: "The functionality of networks can now be enriched without hardware changes while retaining the capability of processing packets at very high rates, even above Terabits per second") \cite{daiet}
        \item Few solutions out there already: Daiet \cite{daiet}, SHArP \cite{sharp}, NetChain \cite{netchain}, IncBricks \cite{incbricks}

    \textbf{Problem statement}\\
    For the time being, it seems that there is still no \gls{rm} that takes into account the presence of a network having a data plane that supports (partially or completely) INP

    \vspace{5mm}

    \textbf{Goals}\\
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Model and evaluate an API through which applications can ask for INP resources
        \item Discuss the importance of a scheduler which can reject INP requests and propose their server-only equivalent when needed (e.g., high switch utilization)
    \end{enumerate}
