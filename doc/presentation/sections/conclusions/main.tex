\begin{frame}{Conclusions}

    \small{This thesis aims to foresee some features that an ideal fully-\gls{inp} aware \glsentrylong{rm} should have, as well as some open problems in the \gls{inp} resource management field.}

    \textbf{Fully \texorpdfstring{\glsentryshort{inp}}{INP}-aware \texorpdfstring{\glsentryshort{rm}}{RM} features}\\
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Conjunct placement of server and switch resources
        \item \gls{inp} alternatives 
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{1mm}

    \textbf{Open problems}\\
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Accurately determine \gls{stc} values for all \gls{inp} solutions
        \item Determine number of needed switch tasks for \gls{inp} solutions
        \item Differentiate \gls{inp} solutions based on their life cycle (e.g., short-term batch jobs vs. long-term services)
    \end{itemize}
