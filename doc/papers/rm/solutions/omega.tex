Omega \cite{omega} is a parallel, lock-free and optimistic cluster scheduler by Google.\\
There is no central resource allocator: all of the resource-allocation decisions take place in the schedulers. This solution makes use of a data structure (called \textit{cell state}) containing information about all the resource allocation in the cluster. Each cell has a shared copy of this data structure, and each scheduler is given a private, local, frequently-updated copy of cell state that it uses for making scheduling decisions.\\
According to the optimistic concurrency technique, once a scheduler makes a placement decision, it updates the shared copy of cell state with a transaction. Whether or not the transaction succeeds, the scheduler resyncs its local copy of cell state afterwards and, if necessary, re-runs its scheduling algorithm and tries again.
