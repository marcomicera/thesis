CloudMirror \cite{cloudmirror} allows client applications to specify bandwidth and high availability guarantees: this can be done by providing a \textit{Tenant Application Graph} (TAG), a directed graph where each vertex represents an application component and links' weights represent the minimum requested bandwidth. An heuristic VM placement algorithm then tries to solve this NP-hard allocation problem.
