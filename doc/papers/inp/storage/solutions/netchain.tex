The network device in charge of storing the distributed storage/cache is a programmable switch: this brings an obvious limitation in terms of storage size, which makes NetChain \cite{netchain} an acceptable solution only when a small amount of critical data must be stored in the network data plane (e.g., locks). NetChain \cite{netchain} also processes queries entirely in the network data plane.
