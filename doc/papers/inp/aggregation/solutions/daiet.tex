Solution for partition/aggregate data center applications (big data analysis such as MapReduce \cite{mapreduce}, machine learning, graph processing and stream processing).\\
The network controller pushes a set of rules to network devices in order to
\begin{mylist}
    \item establish an aggregation tree (spanning tree) and
    \item perform per-tree aggregation
\end{mylist}. Network devices store two hash tables (with single-element buckets) for each tree: one for the keys and one for the values. The aggregated data is flushed to the next node when all the children have sent their intermediate results. Data is also flushed in case of collision in the hash table.\\
